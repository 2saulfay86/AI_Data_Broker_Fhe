# AI Data Broker: Your Personal Data Guardian ðŸ¤–ðŸ”’

AI Data Broker is an innovative application that harnesses **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to redefine how personal data is managed and monetized. By acting as a personal AI agent, this solution empowers users to securely store, negotiate, and profit from their own data without compromising on privacy.

## The Challenge of Data Privacy and Monetization

In today's digital landscape, individuals often lose control over their personal data, which is exploited by corporations without fair compensation. This leads to a significant privacy concern, as users have little to no say in how their data is shared or monetized. Current platforms typically handle data transactions in a way that benefits corporations, leaving users vulnerable and uninformed about their own information.

## Zama's FHE Solution

Our solution leverages **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, to encrypt user data fully. Using FHE, data can be processed while still encrypted, allowing the AI agent to negotiate, price, and authorize data usage without ever exposing the actual data itself. This unique approach ensures that users retain ultimate control over their information, fostering true data sovereignty.

## Core Functionalities at a Glance

- **Personal AI Agent:** Each user is designated a personal AI agent that securely manages their FHE-encrypted data.
- **Automated Data Transactions:** The AI agent automatically handles negotiations and transactions on behalf of the user, streamlining the process of monetizing personal data.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Users regain the power to dictate how and when their data is used, ensuring increased transparency and security in data handling.
- **Data Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface allows individuals to monitor and configure their AI agent efficiently.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK (Concrete, TFHE-rs):** For robust and secure data encryption.
- **Node.js:** For backend functionality.
- **Hardhat/Foundry:** For smart contract development and testing.

## Project Structure

Below is the directory structure of the AI Data Broker project:

```
AI_Data_Broker_Fhe/
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AI_Data_Broker.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ai_agent.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Installation Guide

To get started with the AI Data Broker project, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Ensure you have Node.js and Hardhat/Foundry installed on your machine.

2. **Download and Extract the Project Files:**
   Ensure you have the project files available on your local environment.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will fetch all required dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries.

**Note:** Do not use `git clone` or any URLs to download the project files.

## Build & Run Guide

Once the dependencies are installed, you can compile and run the project using these commands:

1. **Compile Contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
   
2. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

## Code Example

Hereâ€™s a sample snippet of how the AI agent interacts with the FHE system to process a data transaction:

```javascript
const { FHEEncryption } = require('zama-fhe-sdk');

// Initialize FHE encryption
const encryption = new FHEEncryption();

// Encrypt user data
const userData = 'Sensitive Information';
const encryptedData = encryption.encrypt(userData);

// AI agent negotiates a deal
async function negotiateDataAccess(encryptedData) {
    const dealTerms = await AI_Agent.negotiate(encryptedData);
    return dealTerms;
}

// Execute data transaction
negotiateDataAccess(encryptedData).then(terms => {
    console.log("Negotiation successful:", terms);
}).catch(err => {
    console.error("Error during negotiation:", err);
});
```
